# StoneFruit

StoneFruit is a command-line hosting framework for commandlets and verbs. Stone Fruit will help you build small utilities for a variety of purposes, which allow easy functionality extensions.

## What Does It Do?

Think about the popular `git` application. The command `git` doesn't do much by itself, the power comes when you specify a **verb** like `git add` or `git checkout`. Each different verb causes the application to behave in a particular way, including taking a different set of arguments and producing different output effects. StoneFruit is sort of like that, an ability to create a hosting application which hosts **verbs**. Each verb is like a tiny, self-contained program which takes it's own set of arguments and does it's own thing.
